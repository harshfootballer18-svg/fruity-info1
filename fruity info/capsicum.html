Capsicum, also known as bell pepper, is a colorful and mildly
sweet vegetable widely used in cooking around the world.
It originated in Central and South America, where it was first
cultivated thousands of years ago by ancient civilizations.
After the Columbian exchange, capsicum spread to Europe, Asia,
and Africa, becoming a popular ingredient in many regional cuisines.
Nutritionally, capsicums are rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, antioxidants, 
and dietary fiber. They also contain beneficial plant compounds like
carotenoids, which support eye and skin health. Low in calories and 
high in nutrients, capsicum is a vibrant and healthy addition to
any diet.
