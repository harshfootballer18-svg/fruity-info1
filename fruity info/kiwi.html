        Kiwi, also known as kiwifruit, is a small brown fruit
        with bright green flesh and a sweet-tangy flavor.
        It originally comes from China, where it was called
        the “Chinese gooseberry.” The fruit was later introduced
        to New Zealand, renamed “kiwi,” and eventually became 
        popular worldwide. Today, it is grown in countries like
        Italy, New Zealand, Chile, and India. Kiwi is highly 
        nutritious, especially known for its very high vitamin C
        content, which boosts immunity. It also provides fiber, 
        vitamin K, vitamin E, antioxidants, and potassium.
        These nutrients support digestion, improve heart health,
        and contribute to overall wellness.
